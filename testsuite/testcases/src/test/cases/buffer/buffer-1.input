<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Arriving in Japan</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>Japan has strict regulations about bringing firearms, pornography, and narcotics into the country. Anyone caught with drugs is likely to be detained, deported, and refused reentry into Japan. Certain fresh fruits, vegetables, plants, and animals are also illegal. Nonresidents are allowed to bring in duty-free: (1) 400 cigarettes or 100 cigars or 500 grams of tobacco; (2) three bottles of alcohol; (3) 2 ounces of perfume; (4) other goods up to &yen;200,000 value.

</P>

<P>To use your U.S.-purchased electric-powered equipment, bring a converter and adapter. The electrical current in Japan is 100 volts, 50 cycles alternating current (AC) in eastern Japan, and 100 volts, 60 cycles in western Japan; the United States runs on 110-volt, 60-cycle AC current. Wall outlets in Japan accept plugs with two flat prongs, like in the United States, but do not accept U.S. three-prong plugs.

</P>

<P>

If your appliances are dual-voltage, you'll need only an adapter. Don't use 110-volt outlets, marked "For Shavers Only," for high-wattage appliances such as blow-dryers. Most laptops operate equally well on 110 and 220 volts and so require only an adapter. Check your owner's manual or your laptop's specifications if you are unsure.</P>

</P>

<P>Propriety is an important part of Japanese society and culture. Many Japanese expect foreigners to behave differently and are tolerant of faux pas, but they are pleasantly surprised when people acknowledge and observe their customs. The easiest way to ingratiate yourself with the Japanese is to take time to learn and respect Japanese ways.

</P>

<P>

The concept of being fashionably late does not exist in Japan; it is extremely important to be prompt for both social and business occasions. Japanese addresses tend to be complicated, and traffic is often heavy, so allow for adequate travel time. 

</P>

<P>

It is customary to bow upon meeting someone. The art of bowing is not simple; the depth of your bow depends on your social position in respect to that of the other person. Younger people, or those of lesser status, must bow deeper in order to indicate their respect and acknowledge their position. Foreigners are not expected to understand the complexity of these rules, and a basic nod of the head will suffice. Many Japanese are familiar with Western customs and will offer a hand for a handshake.

</P>

<P>

Do not be offended if you are not invited to someone's home. Most entertaining among Japanese is done in restaurants or bars. It is an honor when you are invited to a home; this means your host feels comfortable and close to you. If you do receive an invitation, bring along a small gift -- a souvenir from your country is always the best present, but food and liquor or anything that can be consumed (and not take up space in the home) are also appreciated. Upon entering a home, remove your shoes in the foyer and put on the slippers that are provided (in Japan, shoes are for wearing outdoors only). It is important to have socks or stockings that are in good condition.

</P>

<P>

Japanese restaurants often provide a small hot towel called an <I>oshibori.</I> This is to wipe your hands but not your face. You may see some Japanese wiping their faces with their oshibori, but sometimes this is considered to be in bad form. If you must use your oshibori to remove forehead perspiration, wipe your face first, then your hands. When you are finished with your oshibori, do not just toss it back onto the table, but fold or roll it up.

</P>

<P>

If you are not accustomed to eating with chopsticks, ask for a fork instead. When taking food from a shared dish, do not use the parts of the chopsticks that have entered your mouth; use the end that you have been holding in your hand.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Business Etiquette</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>As Japan's role in the global economy expands, the number of business travelers to this country increases. Although many business practices are universal, certain customs remain unique to Japan. It is not necessary to observe these precepts, but the Japanese always appreciate it if you do.

</P>

<P>

In Japan, <I>meishi</I> (business cards) are mandatory. Upon meeting someone for the first time, it is common to bow and proffer your business card simultaneously. Although English-only business cards suffice, it is better to have one side printed in Japanese (there are businesses in Japan that provide this service in 24 hours). Japanese sometimes have difficulty with Western names, and referring to the cards is helpful. Also, in a society where hierarchy matters, Japanese like to know job titles and rank, so it is useful if your card indicates your position in your company. Japanese often place the business cards they have received in front of them on a table or desk as they conduct their meetings. Follow suit and do not simply shove the card in your pocket.

</P>

<P>

Most Japanese are not accustomed to using first names in business circumstances. Even coworkers of 20 years' standing use surnames. Unless you are sure that the person with whom you are dealing is comfortable with Western customs, it is best to stick to last names and use the honorific word <I>-san</I> after the name, as in <I>Tanaka-san</I> (Mr. or Mrs. Tanaka). Also, respect the hierarchy, and as much as possible address yourself to the most senior person in the room.

</P>

<P>

Don't be frustrated if decisions are not made instantly. Rarely empowered to make decisions, individual businesspeople must confer with their colleagues and superiors. Even if you are annoyed, don't express anger or aggression. Losing one's temper is equated with losing face in Japan.

</P>

<P>

The separation of business and personal life is sacrosanct in Japan, and it is best not to ask about personal matters. Rather than ask about a person's family, for instance, it is better in conversation to stick to neutral subjects. This does not mean that you can only comment on the weather, just that you should take care not to be nosy.

</P>

<P>

Because of cramped housing, many Japanese entertain in restaurants or bars. It is not customary for Japanese businessmen to bring wives along. If you are traveling with your spouse, do not assume that an invitation includes both of you. You may ask if it is acceptable to bring your spouse, but remember that it is awkward for a Japanese person to say no. You should pose the question carefully, such as "Will your [wife or husband] come along, too?" This eliminates the need for a direct, personal refusal.

</P>

<P>

Entertaining is usually done over dinner, followed by an evening on the town. Drinking is something of a national pastime in Japan. If you would rather not suffer from a hangover the next day, do not refuse your drink -- sip, but keep your glass at least half full. Because the custom is for companions to pour drinks for each other, an empty glass is nearly the equivalent of requesting another drink. Whatever you do, don't pour your own drink, and if a glass at your table happens to be empty, show your attentiveness by filling it for your companion.

</P>

<P>

For women traveling on business in this country it is important to remember that many Japanese women do not have careers. In addition, many Japanese businessmen do not yet know how to interact with Western businesswomen. They may be uncomfortable, aloof, or patronizing. Be patient and, if the need arises, gently remind them that, professionally, you expect to be treated as any man would be.

</P>



<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Nightlife Tours</B></FONT>

</P>

<P><B>Sunrise Tours</B> (<FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/5620-9500) offers night tours (6-11:30) of Tokyo, which, depending on your selection, include Kabuki drama at the Kabuki-za, a sukiyaki dinner, or a cabaret-floor show in Roppongi. Prices are &yen;7,500-&yen;13,000, depending on which parts of the tour you include.

</P>

<P><B>Japan Gray Line</B> (<FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/3433-5745) has similar programs.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Orientation Tours</B></FONT>

</P>

<P><B>Sunrise Tours</B> (<FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/5620-9500) and the <B>Japan Gray Line</B> (<FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/3433-5745) run bus excursions around Tokyo with English-speaking guides. Tours vary with the current demands of the market. Most include the Tokyo Tower Observatory, the Imperial East Garden, a demonstration of flower arrangement at the Tasaki Pearl Gallery, and/or a Sumida-gawa cruise to Senso-ji in Asakusa. In general, these are four-hour morning or afternoon tours; a full-day tour (seven hours) combines most of what is covered in half-day excursions with a tea ceremony at Happo Garden and lunch at the traditional Chinzan-so restaurant. Costs range from &yen;3,600 to &yen;11,850. Tours are conducted in large, air-conditioned buses that set out from Hamamatsu-cho Bus Terminal, but there is also free pickup and return from major hotels. (If you travel independently and use the subway, we estimate that you could manage the same full-day itinerary for under &yen;3,000, including lunch.)

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Personal Guides</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>The <B>Japan Guide Association</B> (<FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/3213-2706) provides English-speaking guides. You will need to negotiate your own itinerary and price with the guide. Fees run &yen;20,000-&yen;30,000 for a full eight-hour day.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Special-Interest Tours</B></FONT>

</P>

<P><B>Sunrise Tours</B> (<FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/5620-9500) offers trips to Tokyo Disneyland on Tuesday and Friday, but only in one direction: buses pick up passengers at major hotels but let them find their own way back to Tokyo at the end of the day. The cost is &yen;9,100.

</P>

<P>Communicating in Japan can be a challenge, not because the Japanese don't speak English but because most of us know little, if any, Japanese. It is worthwhile to take some time before you leave home to learn a few basic words, such as where (<I>doko</I>), what time (<I>nan-ji</I>), bathroom (<I>o-te-arai</I>), thanks (<I>arigato gozaimasu</I>), excuse me (<I>sumimasen</I>), and please (<I>onegai shimasu</I>).

</P>

<P>

English is a required subject in Japanese schools, so most Japanese study it for nearly a decade. This does not mean everyone <I>speaks</I> English. Schools emphasize reading, writing, and grammar. As a result, many Japanese can read English but can speak only a few basic phrases. Furthermore, when asked, "Do you speak English?" many Japanese, out of modesty, say no, even if they do speak a little. It is usually best to simply ask what you really want to know slowly, clearly, and as simply as possible. If the person you ask understands, he or she will answer or perhaps take you where you need to go.

</P>

<P>

Although locals may understand your question, they cannot always give you an answer if it entails complicated instructions. For example, you may ask someone on the subway how to get to a particular stop, and he may direct you to the train across the platform and then say something in Japanese that you do not understand. You may discover too late that the train runs express to the suburbs after the third stop; the person who gave you directions was trying to tell you to switch trains at the third stop. To avoid this kind of trouble, ask more than one person for directions every step of the way. You can avoid that trip to the suburbs if you ask someone <I>on</I> the train how to get where you want to go. Also, remember that politeness is a matter of course in Japan and that the Japanese won't want to lose face by saying that they don't know how to get somewhere. If the situation gets confusing, bow, say <I>arigato gozaimashita</I> ("thank you" in the past tense), and ask someone else. Even though you are communicating on a very basic level, misunderstandings can happen easily.

</P>

<P>

Traveling in Japan can be problematic if you don't read Japanese. Before you leave home, buy a phrase book that shows English, English transliterations of Japanese (<I>romaji</I>), and Japanese characters (<I>kanji</I> and <I>kana</I>). You will read the <I>romaji</I> to pick up a few Japanese words and match the kanji and kana in the phrase book with characters on signs and menus. When all else fails, ask for help by pointing to the Japanese words in your book.

</P>

<P>

Learning Japanese is a major commitment. Japanese writing alone consists of three character systems: <I>kanji,</I> characters borrowed and adapted from China centuries ago, which represent ideas; and two forms of <I>kana</I> -- <I>hiragana</I> and <I>katakana</I> -- which represent sounds. Hiragana is used to write some Japanese words, verb inflections, and adjectives; katakana is used for foreign words, slang expressions, and technical terms. There are two sets of 47 kana and more than 6,000 kanji, although most Japanese use fewer than 1,000 kanji. This is obviously more than a tourist can learn in a short stay, so you will find yourself scanning your surroundings for <I>romaji,</I> which are easier to interpret.

</P>

<P>

The most common system of writing Japanese words in Roman letters is the modified Hepburn system, which spells out Japanese words phonetically and is followed on this site.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Gai-jin and Gai-koku-jin</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>There is some disagreement over the use of gai-jin (literally, "outside person") as opposed to <I>gai-koku-jin</I> (literally, "outside country person") because the former has negative echoes of the days of Japanese isolationism. In the 17th and 18th centuries, when the Japanese had contact only with Dutch traders, Westerners were called <I>butta-kusai</I> (literally, "stinking of butter") -- obviously a derogatory term. Gai-koku-jin, on the other hand, has a softer, more polite meaning, and many Westerners in Japan prefer it because it has no xenophobic taint.

</P>

<P>

We have chosen to use the word gai-jin instead of gai-koku-jin to translate the word <I>foreigner</I> for two reasons. First, it is commonly used in books written by Westerners who have lived in Japan, and as such it has wider recognition value. Second, as Japan becomes more global -- especially its younger generation -- gai-jin is losing its negative sense. Many Japanese use gai-jin as the one word they know to describe non-Japanese and most often mean no offense by it.

</P>

<P>

So if children giggle and point at the <I>gai-jin-san,</I> know that it is meant with only the kindest fascination. And if you feel that extra politeness is appropriate, use gai-koku-jin with colleagues whom you respect -- or with whomever might be using gai-jin a bit too derogatorily.

</P>

<P>The Japanese postal service is very efficient. Although numerous post offices exist in every city, it is probably best to use the central post office near the main train station because the workers speak English and can handle foreign mail. Some of the smaller post offices are not equipped to send packages.

</P>

<P>

Post offices are open weekdays 8-5 and Saturday 8-noon. The main <B>International Post Office</B> is on the Imperial Palace side of JR Tokyo Eki (2-3-3 Ote-machi, Chiyoda-ku, <FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/3241-4891). It is open 24 hours year-round.

</P>

<P>

Most hotels have stamps and will mail your letters and postcards; they will also give you directions to the nearest post office.

</P>

<P>

The Japanese postal service has implemented use of three-numeral-plus-four postal codes, but their policy is similar to that in the United States regarding ZIP-plus-fours; that is, addresses with the three-numeral code will still arrive at their destination, albeit perhaps one or two days later. Mail to rural towns may take longer. Your local JNTO, consulate, or embassy will provide the four-digit codes if you need them, though they aren't essential.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Postal Rates</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>It costs &yen;110 to send a letter by air to North America and Europe. An airmail postcard costs &yen;70. Aerograms cost &yen;90.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Receiving Mail</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>To get mail, have parcels and letters sent poste restante at the central post office in major cities; unclaimed mail is returned after 30 days. Tokyo's <B>American Express</B> office (Halifax Bldg., 16-26 Roppongi 3-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo) is another good place to have mail sent.</P><P>Japan is expensive, but there are ways to cut costs. This requires, to some extent, an adventurous spirit and the courage to stray from the standard tourist paths. A good way to economize is to avoid taxis (they tend to get stuck in traffic anyway) and try the inexpensive, efficient subway system; instead of going to a restaurant with menus in English and Western-style food, go to places where you can rely on your good old index finger to point to the dish you want, and try food that the Japanese eat.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Currency</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>The unit of currency in Japan is the yen (&yen;). There are bills of &yen;10,000, &yen;5,000, and &yen;1,000. Coins are &yen;500, &yen;100, &yen;50, &yen;10, &yen;5, and &yen;1. Japanese currency floats on the international monetary exchange, so changes can be dramatic.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Exchanging Money and Funds Transfers</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>Most hotels will change both traveler's checks and notes into yen. However, their rates are always lower than at banks. Because Japan is safe and free of street crime, you may consider exchanging large sums of money into yen at banks at any time. Most of the larger banks have a foreign exchange counter. Banking hours are weekdays 9-3.

</P>

<P>

Major banks can transfer funds to and from overseas. Two banks that may be familiar to you are <B>Bank of America</B> (Arc Mori Bldg., 1-12-32 Akasaka, Minato-ku, <FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/3587-3111; Subway: Namboku subway line, Tameike Sanno Eki, Exit 13) and <B>Citibank</B> (2-3-14 Higashi-Shinagawa, Shinagawa-ku, <FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>0120/50-4189 toll-free; Subway: JR Shinagawa Eki, higashi-guchi/east exit).

</P>

<P><B>American Express</B> has a banking office in its headquarters in the American Express Tower (4-30-16 Ogikubo, Suginami-ku, <FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/3220-6100; Subway: JR Chuo Line, Ogikubo Eki, higashi-guchi/east exit) and at its branch in the Yuraku-cho Denki Building (1-7-1 Yuraku-cho, Chiyoda-ku, <FONT CLASS="text2">PHONE: </FONT>03/3214-0280; Subway: JR Yamanote Line or Hibiya subway line, Yuraku-cho Eki, nishi-guchi/west exit for JR and Exit A2 for Hibiya Line).

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Taxes</B></FONT>

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head5">

Hotel</FONT></P>

<P>A 5% federal consumer tax is added to all hotel bills. Another 3% local tax is added to the bill if it exceeds &yen;15,000. You may save money by paying for hotel meals separately rather than charging them to your bill.

</P>

<P>

At first-class, full-service, and luxury hotels, a 10% service charge is added to the bill in place of individual tipping. At the more expensive ryokan, where individualized maid service is offered, the service charge is usually 15%. At business hotels, minshuku, youth hostels, and economy inns, no service charge is added to the bill.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head5">

Sales</FONT></P>

<P>There is an across-the-board, nonrefundable 5% consumer tax levied on all sales. Since the tax was introduced in 1989, vendors have either been absorbing the tax in their quoted retail prices or adding it on to the sale. Before you make a major purchase, inquire if tax is extra.

</P>

<P>

A 5% federal consumer tax is added to all restaurant bills. Another 3% local tax is added to the bill if it exceeds &yen;7,500. At the more expensive restaurants, a 10%-15% service charge is added to the bill.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Tipping</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>Tipping is not common in Japan. It is not necessary to tip taxi drivers, or at beauty parlors, barber shops, bars, or nightclubs. A chauffeur for a hired car usually receives a tip of &yen;500 for a half-day excursion and &yen;1,000 for a full-day trip. Porters charge fees of &yen;250-&yen;300 per bag at railroad stations and &yen;200 per piece at airports. 

</P>

<P>

It is not customary to tip employees of hotels, even porters, unless a special service has been rendered. In such cases, a gratuity of &yen;2,000 or &yen;3,000 should be placed in an envelope and handed to the staff member discreetly.

</P>



<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Passport Offices</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>The best time to apply for a passport or to renew is during the fall and winter. Before any trip, check your passport's expiration date, and, if necessary, renew it as soon as possible.

</P>

<P>You can make international calls from the green phones that have gold plates indicating in English that they can be used for such calls.

</P>

<P>

There are three Japanese companies that provide international service: KDD (001), ITJ (0041), and IDC (0061). Dial: company code + country code + city/area code and number of your party. KDD offers the clearest connection but is also the most expensive.

</P>

<P>

Telephone credit cards are especially convenient for international calls. For operator assistance in English on long-distance calls, dial 0051.

</P>

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Long-Distance Calls</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint access codes make calling long distance convenient, but you may find the local access number blocked in many hotel rooms. First ask the hotel operator to connect you. If the hotel operator balks, ask for an international operator or dial the international operator yourself. One way to improve your odds of getting connected to your long-distance carrier is to travel with more than one company's calling card (a hotel may block Sprint, for example, but not MCI). If all else fails call from a pay phone.

<P><FONT CLASS="head4"><B>Public Phones</B></FONT>

</P>

<P>Pay phones are one of the great delights of Japan. Not only are they conveniently located in hotels, restaurants, and on street corners, but pay phones, at &yen;10 for three minutes, have to be one of the few remaining bargains in Japan.

</P>

<P>

Telephones come in three styles: pink, red, and green. Pink phones, for local calls, accept only &yen;10 coins. Most red phones are only for local use, but some accept &yen;100 coins and can be used for long-distance domestic calls. Domestic long-distance rates are reduced as much as 50% after 9 PM (40% after 7 PM). Green phones take coins and often accept telephone cards -- disposable cards of fixed value that you use up in increments of &yen;10. Telephone cards, sold in vending machines, hotels, and a variety of stores, are tremendously convenient because you will not have to search for the correct change.

<P>The best seasons to travel to Japan are spring and fall, when the weather is best. In spring, the country is warm, with only occasional showers, and flowers grace landscapes in both rural and urban areas. The first harbingers of spring are plum blossoms in early March; <I>sakura</I> (cherry blossoms) follow, usually arriving in Tokyo by mid-April.

</P>

<P>

Summer brings on the rainy season, with particularly heavy rains and mugginess in July. Fall is a welcome relief, with clear blue skies and beautiful foliage. Occasionally a few surprise typhoons occur in early fall, but the storms are usually as quick to leave as they are to arrive. Winter is gray and chilly, with little snow in most areas. Temperatures rarely fall below freezing.

</P>

<P>

For the most part, the climate is temperate, similar to that of the East Coast of the United States. 

</P>

<P>

In general, the Japanese tend to take their vacations at the same time, on specific holidays. As a result, planes, trains, and hotels are booked far in advance. Many businesses, shops, and restaurants are closed during these holidays. Holiday periods include the days before and after New Year's; Golden Week, which follows Greenery Day (April 29); and mid-August, at the time of the Obon festivals, when many Japanese return to their hometowns.

Average maximum and minimum temperatures for Tokyo are as follows: Jan.-Feb., 29-48&deg;F (-2-9&deg;C); Mar.-Apr., 35-62&deg;F (2-17&deg;C); May-June, 53-75&deg;F (12-24&deg;C); July-Aug., 70-86&deg;F (21-30&deg;C); Sept.-Oct., 56-78&deg;F (13-26&deg;C), Nov.-Dec., 33-60&deg;F (1-16&deg;C).

This directory contains the source code for JFlex.

For your convenience, the following generated lexer and parser files
are included in the distribution:

JFlex/LexScan.java  (lexer, generated from src/LexScan.flex)
JFlex/LexParse.java (parser, generated from src/LexParse.cup)
JFlex/sym.java      (parser symbols, generated from src/LexParse.cup)


Dependencies:
If you just want to compile the sources, no further tools are necessary.

If you want to build jflex from scratch and/or want to run the unit tests, 
you need the following:
junit >= 3.8.1     [http://www.junit.org/]
cup   >= 0.10l     [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/]
jflex >= 1.4pre1   [http://www.jflex.de/]
ant   >= 1.4       [optional, http://ant.apache.org/]


Dir contents:
build.xml:
  for use with the ant build tool [http://ant.apache.org/]
  
  Instructions: put junit.jar into you class path,
  put JFlex.jar and java_cup.jar (with java_cup ant task) 
  into the ant lib directory. Now you can run Ant.
  Useful targets are:

  jar:   recompiles all JFlex classes, generates lexer+parser 
         only if necessary, zips up all compiled classes in
         ../lib/JFlex.jar

  build: cleans up everything and does a completely new build

  realclean: deletes generated, temporary and *.class files
 
manifest:
  jar manifest file for JFlex.jar

skeleton:
  a skeleton file matching exactly the precompiled scanner skeleton.
  Can be used together with the --skel option 

skeleton.nested:
  a skeleton file that supports nested input streams (see the manual 
  for the API). Can be used together with the --skel option
